# User Hobbies

This is a simple web application built with Laravel 6.2 and VueJS that makes it easy for a user to register
and keep track of his/her hobbies and notifies the user when they change.

## Testing

PHPUnit was used to test the application for the backend. To run these test,
[] - clone the repo
[] - `run composer install` to install all the required dependencies
[] - `run vendor/bin/phpunit` to view test
